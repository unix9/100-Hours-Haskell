DAY 2! 

So today, I need to finish Chapter 4 to Chapter 8. Yesterday I only managed to do until Chapter 3. It's okay tho it's still good progress for them. So let's start now. 

Kinda got distracted with Advanced Software Modelling and Design. Damn, I really need to put a focus on one of them. Okay, I want to focus on Advanced Software Modelling and Design for awhile so, please wait.

Oh f**k, I'm so clueless right now. LIKE WTF** I'm supposed to do, okay, let me try finishing a bit of Programming Language Concepts slides and lectures. I think that's a good start innit? XD
