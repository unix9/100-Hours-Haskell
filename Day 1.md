My first day of Haskell coding! Today I'll be solving some of the problems in the problem sheet provided by my university.

Update after 1 hour:

I currently feel overwhelmed and feel so bad. I can't even code a simple zip and unzip function. Well, I could do it simple by just using zip function that Haskell already provides but, for task 1, apparently you need to code your own solution. Well, maybe I really should start from the very beginning again?

I decided that I'll run through the Programming in Haskell by Graham Hutton book and finish it in approximately 5 days. So this is roughly the basic plan.

Day 1 - which is basically today I will run through Chapter 1 to Chapter 4.

Day 2 (16/2/2023) - Chapter 5 to Chapter 8

Day 3 (17/2/2023) - Chapter 9 to Chapter 12

Day 4 (18/2/2023) - Chapter 13 to Chapter 16

Day 5 (19/2/2023) - Chapter 17 + do University problem sheets.

CHAPTER 1 NOTES

oh no, I can't even focus or read the all these texts! hm, maybe i should read line by line slowly? XD, okay nevermind, maybe the seat where I'm sitting on is too noisy for me to focus. Let me go to more quieter study space.

finished my first chapter of reading! quite tiring and mentally exhausting, so i'm probably gonna take a short break.

ok so i've took my short break, now i'll try to do the chapter 1 easy exercises.

i've completed chapter 2 too. i'll probably skip chapter 3 as it mostly says about types and all that stuff which is just the basic stuffs that i already know. i think i'll probably take a break and go to eat at starfried :D.
