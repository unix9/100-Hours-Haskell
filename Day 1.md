My first day of Haskell coding! Today I'll be solving some of the problems in the problem sheet provided by my university.

Update after 1 hour:
I currently feel overwhelmed and feel so bad. I can't even code a simple zip and unzip function. Well, I could do it simple by just using zip function that Haskell already provides but, for task 1, apparently you need to code your own solution. Well, maybe I really should start from the very beginning again?
