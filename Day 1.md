My first day of Haskell coding! Today I'll be solving some of the problems in the problem sheet provided by my university.

Update after 1 hour:

I currently feel overwhelmed and feel so bad. I can't even code a simple zip and unzip function. Well, I could do it simple by just using zip function that Haskell already provides but, for task 1, apparently you need to code your own solution. Well, maybe I really should start from the very beginning again?

I decided that I'll run through the Programming in Haskell by Graham Hutton book and finish it in approximately 5 days. So this is roughly the basic plan.

Day 1 - which is basically today I will run through Chapter 1 to Chapter 4.

Day 2 (16/2/2023) - Chapter 5 to Chapter 8

Day 3 (17/2/2023) - Chapter 9 to Chapter 12

Day 4 (18/2/2023) - Chapter 13 to Chapter 16

Day 5 (19/2/2023) - Chapter 17 + do University problem sheets.
